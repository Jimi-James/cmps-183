\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Original Proposal}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Music tutor website
  \item Inspired by LenMus and Codecademy
  \item Music lessons \& practice, all in Javascript
  \item "Practice" means interactive sections and minigames
  \item Saved progress by user account (database)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Missing Features}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Most lessons
  \item All interactive practice
  \item Saved progress is missing from pythonanywhere, but not the Github or turned in versions
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Bugs}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \sout{Music won't play perfectly in rhythm}
  \item \sout{Music plays all notes at once after the first playing until refresh}
  \item Staff notation doesn't show up until the link to it is clicked twice (a problem with mixing VexFlow with vue.js that has no error message or obvious cause)
  \item Countless other bugs that we've already fixed
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Story}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 2 very complex libraries that are the most popular (and possibly only) options for music notation and MIDI playback in Javascript: VexFlow \& MIDI.js
  \item Both libraries seemed solid and had countless great, working examples
  \item Almost no documentation, and no decent documentation at all
  \item Had to read all of the VexFlow and MIDI.js code to learn how to do almost anything
  \item Spent the entire quarter trying to fix these bugs
  \item Technically a 3rd library, VexTab, which is an addon to VexFlow that makes it a little easier to deal with
  \item VexTab at least worked great and had great documentation
\end{itemize}
